/*! \file
 *
 * This file contains definitions for simple buses used in an emulated
 * processor.
 *
 * Conceptually, a "bus" is a set of wires that communicates a value from a
 * producer to one or more consumers.  A "pin" is an endpoint of a bus.  The
 * connect() functions create a bus and then connect pins to the bus.
 *
 * In the implementation, a bus is actually represented as a variable in memory
 * (in this case, allocated on the heap).  The busdata_t typedef is the data
 * type used for buses.  A "pin" is then simply a variable of type busdata_t*,
 * that holds the address of the bus variable, and therefore can read or write
 * the bus variable.  This means that multiple pins can be connected to a single
 * bus variable, and they can communicate values back and forth by reading and
 * writing to the bus variable.

/*!
 * This function connects two pins together by creating a "bus" between them,
 * and then returns the newly allocated bus.  Since pins are addresses of an
 * uint32_t that can be used to send signals between the pins, this
 * function simply allocates the uint32_t value, then sets the pins to the
 * address of the allocated value.
