/* bus
 *
 *  A bus is a set of wires that communicates
 *  a value from a producer to one or more
 *  consumers.
 *
 *  A pin is an endpoint of a bus.  connect()
 *  creates a bus and connects both pins to it.
 *
 *
 *  Here, we represent a bus as a location in memory.
 *
 *  You cannot use multiple connections to connect
 *    more than two things together.
 *  WRONG:  connect(a,b); connect(b,c);
 *  instead use connect3(a,b,c);
 *  If you need to connect more than 3 things, you'll
 *    need to modify bus.{c,h} to create a suitably
 *    larger connectN().
