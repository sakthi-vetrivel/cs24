 *  the way the units should interact.
 *
 *  In a synchronous processor, clocked registers and combinational dataflow
 *  between the units would serve this same role.
 *
 *  In an asynchronous processor, the units would handshake with each other
 *  on the channels (buses) which interconnect them.
