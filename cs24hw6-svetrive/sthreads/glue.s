# __sthread_switch is the main entry point for the thread scheduler.
# It has three parts:
#
#    1. Save the context of the current thread on the stack.
#       The context includes all of the integer registers and RFLAGS.
#
#    2. Call __sthread_scheduler (the C scheduler function), passing the
#       context as an argument.  The scheduler stack *must* be restored by
#       setting %rsp to the scheduler_context before __sthread_scheduler is
#       called.
#
#    3. __sthread_scheduler will return the context of a new thread.
#       Restore the context, and return to the thread.
