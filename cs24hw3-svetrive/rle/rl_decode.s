# rl_decode:  decode RLE-encoded input into a malloc'd buffer
#
# Author:  Ben Bitdiddle (those guys are lucky I said I'd do this before
#          going on my vacation.  they never appreciate my work ethic!)
#
# Arguments to rl_decode are in these registers (following the System V AMD64
# ABI calling convention):
#
#      %rdi = pointer to buffer containing run-length encoded input data
#
#      %esi = int length of the run-length-encoded data in the buffer
#
#      %rdx = OUTPUT pointer to where the length of the decoded result
#             should be stored
#
# Return-value in %rax is the pointer to the malloc'd buffer containing
# the decoded data.
#

        # We do this by summing up the counts, which are in the odd memory
        # locations.
